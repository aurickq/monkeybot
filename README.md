#Really bad screen bot for Hyperspace center.

##Requirements
- Opaque large radar.  
- Windowed mode. 640x480 and 800x600 work best.  
- Constant window focus.  
- Default brightness settings.  
- Default keybindings.  

##Running
- Make sure Multi-Fire Starts On is checked in View -> Options -> Other if you want multi-fire.  
- Sometimes the keys will stick after closing the bot. Just press left, right, up, down, and control to fix it.  
- Put (public) in Hyperspace folder if you want to use a turret with the bot.  
- The bot will need to be restarted if you change items that adjust energy.  
- You can run the bot in a virtual machine if you want to be able to still use the computer normally.  

##Compiling
- It will probably only compile with Visual Studio 2013.  
- Add _USE_MATH_DEFINES;NOMINMAX to preprocessor definitions.
